Incoming Client Request: A client (such as a browser) makes an HTTP request to a reverse proxy instead of directly to the target server.

Request Processing: The reverse proxy receives the request, analyzes it, and determines which backend server should handle the request. This decision might be based on factors like load balancing, caching, URL rewriting, or other routing logic.

Forwarding the Request: Once the reverse proxy decides which backend server should process the request, it forwards the original request (or a modified version of it) to that backend server. This forwarding is done through an HTTP request (or HTTPS if secured), with the reverse proxy acting as the client to the backend server.

Backend Server Response: The backend server processes the request and sends the response back to the reverse proxy.

Forwarding the Response to Client: Finally, the reverse proxy forwards the backend server's response to the original client, potentially modifying headers or other information as needed.
